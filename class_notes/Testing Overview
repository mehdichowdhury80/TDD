Expectation == Actual

xvy-345 - in Progress, in Development
Dev - Code Unit (Method), IT (Integration Test)
Build and Test - Dev Environment
xvy-345 - In Testing, Ready To Testing (15 test cases)
QA - Smoke, Regression, Integration, Sanity
Test - QA
UAT - BA/QA

Testing Level:
- White Box Testing - DEV (Unit, IT)
- Grey Box Testing - 
- Black Box Testing - QA (Smoke, Sanity, Regression)

Smoke: 200 - All Major Functionalities - 2-5 mins
Regression: 5000 - All available tests validating all functionalities - 1 hour
Sanity: 70 - When regression is not possible we run sanity
Re-Test: Bug fixed, only run that/those tests
